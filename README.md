## üìÑ Description

The **Pok√©mon Adoption Web App** is a full-stack application that lets users browse, filter, and explore Pok√©mon in a fun, adoption-themed interface. It includes detailed profiles for each Pok√©mon, summary analytics, and interactive evolution chains. The app is built with a **React frontend** and an **ASP.NET Core Web API backend**, powered by Pok√©mon data from a JSON dataset.
